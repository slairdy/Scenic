# Scenic

Scenic is a web app for finding nice places to park up, eat a snack, and enjoy the view. It's also a work in progress! Planning to rebuild (and complete) using Redux + Autho0.<br /><br />
Built for Dev Academy 'personal project' - "make a start on a web app using what we've learned so far and present to the class."<br /><br />
